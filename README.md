# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic — A Fun Data Science Practice Project

Welcome aboard the Spaceship Titanic! 🛸 This project is part of my personal learning journey in data science and analytics, inspired by the [Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

I explored this dataset for fun to improve my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and model building using Python. This project helped me practice working with real-world data in a sci-fi themed setting while applying essential data science tools and thinking.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 💡 Explore the dataset and understand the story
- 🧹 Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- 📊 Visualize interesting patterns and trends
- 🧠 Apply machine learning to predict passenger survival (Transported)
- 🧪 Experiment and learn — not aiming for top leaderboard scores, just knowledge!

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Optional: XGBoost / LightGBM for model boosting

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Spaceship Titanic on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data)
- Description: A fictional dataset where passengers are traveling through space. The goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension.

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes various plots like:

- Missing data heatmap
- Passenger age distribution
- Spending behavior across services
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance from models

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

I experimented with several models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting (optional)

Each model was evaluated using accuracy and cross-validation.
